## Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Framework

Ultimate Tic Tac Toe framework in Java, implementing adversarial search using MiniMax with Alpha-Beta pruning. Ultimate Tic Tac Toe comprises nine 3x3 Tic Tac Toe boards, and the goal is to win 3 boards. I also developed a heuristic AI player, which was tested to beat random play in 99 out of 100 games.
